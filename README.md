## Problem Statement and Necessity

Crowdfunding is a popular method for raising funds for various causes. However, existing platforms face challenges:

- **Security:** Traditional e-payment systems are vulnerable to hacking despite encryption. Blockchain offers superior security through decentralization.
- **Transparency and Anti-Fraud:** Many platforms lack transparency, raising concerns about fund misuse. DecentRaised ensures full visibility of fund usage to reduce fraud.
- **Global Contribution:** Geographic limitations can restrict international contributions. Blockchain allows global participation seamlessly.

Inspired by successful initiatives like [CryptoRelief](https://www.cryptorelief.in), DecentRaised aims to set a new standard in crowdfunding.

## Proposed Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Chakra UI (Fully figured out and implemented)
- **Backend:** Currently under development and evaluation. We are exploring options and technologies to best support our smart contracts and overall application.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:** Fork and clone the project to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `yarn install` to install the necessary packages.
3. **Run the Application Locally:** Execute `yarn dev` to start the development server.

## Prerequisites

- **MetaMask:** Install MetaMask as a Google Chrome extension and create an account.
- **Ethereum:** Request Ether from [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) for testing purposes.

## Developing Smart Contracts

1. **Create an Account on Infura:** Sign up at [Infura](https://infura.io).
2. **Setup Environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the Ethereum directory. Add the necessary environment variables once available.
3. **Modify Solidity Contract:** Make necessary changes to the Solidity file as required.
4. **Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts:**
   - **Compile:** Run `node compile.js` to compile the Solidity contracts.
   - **Deploy:** Run `node deploy.js` to deploy the contracts to the Ethereum network (for local development or testnet).

## Future Work

As we continue to develop DecentRaised, our future work includes:

- **Backend Development:** Finalizing and implementing the backend infrastructure to support the frontend and smart contracts.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the application to a production environment and ensuring it is fully operational on the Ethereum mainnet.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Improving the user experience with additional features and a more intuitive interface based on user feedback.
- **Integration Testing:** Conducting extensive testing to ensure all components of the platform interact seamlessly and perform reliably.
- **Scalability Improvements:** Enhancing the platformâ€™s scalability to handle larger volumes of transactions and users.
- **Security Audits:** Performing thorough security audits of smart contracts and the overall application to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
- **Additional Features:** Exploring and implementing new features such as support for different Ethereum networks, integration with other blockchain technologies, and advanced analytics for campaign performance.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress and upcoming features!
